# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition Solutions

## Introduction
Here are my solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. This is a very popular book and it's also referred to as K&R. I _tried_ to use the _best practices_ with the knowledge learned up to each exercise.

The book shows a lot of useful information about the C programming language, but more than that it gives a very good grasp on what programming really mean.

## Compilers

For the first 5 chapters I used the __gcc__ compiler from MinGW compiler collection. A contraction of _"Minimalist GNU for Windows"_. It is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

Later I used the __gcc__ compiler, available in __Windows Subsystem for Linux__ (_WSL_) with the __Ubuntu 18.04__ distribution installed. This compiler has some small advantages, over the __*MinGW*__ version, because the __linux environement__ it's more __*Unix like*__ and this makes the development process of C programs more easy to work with.

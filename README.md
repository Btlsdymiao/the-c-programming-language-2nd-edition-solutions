# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition Solutions

## Introduction
Here are my solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. This is a very popular book and it's also referred to as K&R.

The book shows a lot of useful information about the C programming language, but more than that it gives a very good grasp on what programming really mean.

## Compilers

I tried to use the best practices with the knowledge learned up to each exercise. The used compiler is the __gcc__ from MinGW, a contraction of _"Minimalist GNU for Windows"_. It is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

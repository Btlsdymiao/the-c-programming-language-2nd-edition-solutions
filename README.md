# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition - Solutions

## Introduction
Here are my solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. This is a very popular book and it's also referred to as K&R. I _tried_ to use the _best practices_ with the knowledge learned up to each exercise.

The book shows a lot of useful information about the C programming language, but more than that it gives a very good grasp on what programming really mean.

## Environement
For the programming environement, the __Visual Studio Code__ text editor, was used. On top of this the __C/C++ extension__ was added to have acces to many __useful features__ specific for the C programming language. Also for simplicity the __Code Runner__ extension was used. Were created __specific configurations_ for the environement to accommodate the c programming language needs. 

## Compilers

For the first 5 chapters was used the __gcc__ compiler from MinGW compiler collection. A contraction of _"Minimalist GNU for Windows"_. It is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

Later I used the __gcc__ compiler, available trough __Windows Subsystem for Linux__ (_WSL_) with the __Ubuntu 18.04__ distribution installed. This compiler has some small advantages, over the __*MinGW*__ version, because the __linux environement__ it's more __*Unix Like*__ and this makes the development process of C programs more easy to work with.

## Debugers

The used debuger is __gdb__ debuger, available trough __Windows Subsystem for Linux__ (_WSL_) with the __Ubuntu 18.04__. Also for a __*simple* programming environement__, was created a __build task__ and a __debug task__ in _VS Code_.
